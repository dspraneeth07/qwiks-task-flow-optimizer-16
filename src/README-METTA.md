# MeTTa Implementation for Task Scheduling

This project implements MeTTa concepts for task scheduling and optimization. The implementation includes:

## 1. Graph Representation in MeTTa

The project uses a custom AtomSpace implementation to represent tasks and their dependencies as a graph structure. The main components are:

- **Atoms**: Basic units in the knowledge graph
- **TaskNodes**: Represent individual tasks
- **DependencyLinks**: Represent relationships between tasks

## 2. AtomSpace Manipulation

The MeTTa service provides functions to:
- Add/remove atoms
- Query atoms by type
- Get connected atoms
- Convert between Task objects and MeTTa atoms

## 3. Algorithm Implementation in MeTTa

The following algorithms are implemented using MeTTa principles:

- **Spreading Activation**: Calculates task priorities by propagating "activation energy" through the dependency network
- **Topological Sorting**: Orders tasks based on their dependencies
- **Dependency Path Resolution**: Finds paths between tasks in the dependency graph

## 4. Scheduling Algorithms

The scheduling system uses MeTTa concepts to:
- Optimize task order based on dependencies
- Calculate priorities using spreading activation
- Visualize the atomspace structure
- Provide analytics based on the knowledge graph

## Implementation Notes

The MeTTa implementation is provided as a custom TypeScript service rather than using an external package. This gives us full control over the algorithms and allows seamless integration with the existing task management system.

## SingularityNET Integration

This project aligns with SingularityNET's principles by:
- Using symbolic AI representation (AtomSpace)
- Implementing graph-based reasoning
- Focusing on knowledge representation and manipulation

## Future Enhancements

- External AtomSpace database integration
- More advanced reasoning algorithms
- Integration with SingularityNET marketplace services
